    "## Plotting time series in ARTop\n",
    "\n",
    "Time series in ARTop are based on Pandas DataFrames (https://pandas.pydata.org/) which are highly portable. Here we present some examples of the time series functionality in ARTop.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The time series variables in ARTop have the names:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "windCur   : current-carrying part of winding rate (km^4/s)\n",
    "helCur    : current-carrying part of field line helicity rate (Gauss^2km^4/s)\n",
    "windPot   : potential part of winding rate (km^4/s)\n",
    "helPot    : potential part of helicity rate (Gauss^2km^4/s)\n",
    "windBraid : braiding component of winding rate (km^4/s)\n",
    "helBraid  : braiding component of helicity rate (Gauss^2km^4/s)\n",
    "wind      : total winding rate (km^4/s)\n",
    "hel       : total helicity rate (Gauss^2km^4/s)\n",
    "dL        : delta winding rate (km^$/s)\n",
    "dH        : delta helicity rate (Gauss^2km^4/s)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "These are stored in a Pandas DataFrame, and each variable is accessed using one of the above keys. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For time-integrated versions of these variables (see Example 1), `_int` is added to every variable name.\n",
    "\n",
    "For running mean and envelope calculations (see Example 2), `_ms` is added to every variable name.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example variables are included below, but you should adapt them for the data you have."
